"""
deleted-files-analyzing.py

This script parses a Git conflict summary (conflicts.txt) to extract and visualize cases where a file was
**deleted in the new branch but modified in HEAD** â€” typically resulting in a 'modify/delete' conflict.

It builds a **tree-like directory structure** from these paths to help developers quickly locate and understand
where such conflicts occurred in the project hierarchy.

Key Features:
-------------
- Parses lines matching the 'CONFLICT (modify/delete)' pattern
- Groups conflicts by folder using a nested dictionary
- Prints a visual tree of affected folders and files
- Highlights only files that were **deleted remotely but still modified locally**
